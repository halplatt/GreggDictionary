    <h1>Gregg Shorthand Reverse Dictionary Lookup List</h1>
    <div>
  <p>Search for Gregg Anniversary outlines using a text-based representation of the shorthand strokes.</p>

  <p>Here's how it works:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use the characters in the outline, separated by hyphens (<code>-</code>).</li>
    <li>If parts of the outline are disjointed, separate them with a slash (<code>/</code>).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>ðŸ‘‰ <strong>Example:</strong> Type <code>s/v-i-s-r</code>, then click "Search GST" â€” you'll get the outline for <em>supervisor</em>.</p>
</div>
    <h2>Notation Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a description of the notation used to represent the Gregg outlines. The entries in this dictionary are notated as in the following example:
    </p>
    <pre>b-ld/s (s2)</pre>
    <p>
        This indicates a shorthand outline composed of the letter <strong>b</strong>, an <strong>ld</strong> blend, and disjoined <strong>s</strong>. The "(s2)" indicates that the <strong>s</strong> is a left <strong>s</strong>.

        Occasionally there are clarifications in parentheses after the outlines. These are used to give additional details about the outlines, if needed. In particular, letters that can be written in more than one way are notated with numbers afterwards. In these cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong>: Indicates that the letter is written clockwise.</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong>: Indicates that it is written counterclockwise.</li>
