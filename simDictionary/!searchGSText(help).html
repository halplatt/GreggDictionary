        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            YAGATS is a system that allows us to type romanized Gregg Shorthand outlines on an ASCII computer keyboard.
            This document lists the symbols used in YAGATS, briefly discusses the goals of the system design, and speculates
            about how a computer application might parse text written in YAGATS.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a reference document, not a tutorial. Learning to translate outlines into YAGATS from this document
            would be difficult. A friendly tutorial with examples and exercises might be created at some point in the future.

        <h2>1. The Inventory of YAGATS Symbols</h2>
        <p>
            YAGATS (Yet Another Gregg-ASCII Transliteration System) uses "symbols" consisting of ASCII characters to represent
            the strokes and punctuation marks of Gregg Shorthand. The symbols are case-sensitive. There are approximately 73 symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some YAGATS symbols consist of two characters. These symbols are called "digraphs." Other symbols consist of a single
            character. For lack of a better word, such a symbol is called a "unigraph."
        </p>

        <h3>Unigraphs</h3>
        <pre>
a  the "a" stroke, the large vowel circle
e  the "e" stroke, the tiny vowel circle
i  the "long i" stroke, the indented circle
o  the "o" hook
u  the "oo" hook
s  the "comma s" stroke
f  the "f" stroke
v  the "v" stroke
z  the "left s" stroke
p  the "p" stroke
b  the "b" stroke
m  the "m" stroke
n  the "n" stroke
k  the "k" stroke
g  the "gay" stroke
r  the "r" stroke
l  the "l" stroke
t  the "t" stroke
d  the "d" stroke
(  the "over ith" stroke
)  the "under ith" stroke
...
        </pre>

        <h3>Digraphs</h3>
        <pre>
au  the a circle + oo hook diphthong as in "now"
ea  the circle with a dot inside as in "panacea"
eu  the e circle + oo hook as in "youth"
io  the circle within a circle as in "lion"
oe  the o hook + e circle as in "joy"
ya  the ya- loop as in "yarn"
ye  the ye- loop as in "yell"
NT  the nd/nt blend as in "rend" and "rent"
...
        </pre>

        <h2>2. Unresolved Matters</h2>
        <p>
            (1) YAGATS currently does not have a mechanism for notating the "reversing principle" used in some pre-WW2 editions of Gregg.
            The backslash (\) appended after the reversed vowel is under consideration, e.g., "a\".
        </p>
        <p>
            (2) Currently there is no mechanism for representing "diacritical marks" such as the long vowel indicator often written
            under the o-hook when it stands for the exclamation "oh!"
        </p>
        <p>
            (3) When a US outline has a different UK counterpart, e.g., "schedule," can the UK outline somehow be included in the same
            line of the lexicon file, or must a separate lexicon file for a so-called "UK dialect" be created?
        </p>

        <h2>3. Discussion of the Design of YAGATS</h2>
        <p>
            The design of YAGATS is a compromise between legibility and ease of learning for human users versus simplicity of parsing
            for computers. A system consisting entirely of one-character symbols would make it slightly easier to write parsing
            applications but would require human users to memorize bizarre and arbitrary symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the symbol allocations were obvious choices: "b" for the b stroke, "au" for the a+oo diphthong, and so forth.
            After the obvious choices were made, it was necessary to assign symbols to the remaining graphemes of Gregg Shorthand.

        <h2>4. Parsing YAGATS Text with a Computer Application</h2>
        <p>
            Assume you have opened a text file containing many shorthand sentences written in YAGATS notation. To parse this material
            (in order to translate it to longhand, or to draw the outlines, or to calculate symbol frequencies, for example), the
            following steps would be taken:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the incoming text into individual sentences.</li>
            <li>Divide the current sentence into "words."</li>
            <li>Process each word.</li>
            <li>Identify individual strokes.</li>
        </ol>
